 <p>This is a list of my favorite people that I know personally. This list is especially great because I know how they are and how awesome they are. </br> </br> 
 <ul>
	<li>Noah Daniel Moya</li>
	<p>Noah is a m a z i n g. We have been together for over 5 years and I have gotten to know him so well. He is very passionate about what he believes in. Whenever we talk about things he is interested in, he knows what he is talking about. He is funny and makes me happy. Noah also isn't lame. He can be much sometimes but that is just who he is. He is very special and prodigious and amazing.
